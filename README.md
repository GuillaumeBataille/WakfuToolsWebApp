# WakfuToolsWebApp

A website app with many tools to help with the game "Wakfu" from Ankama

To launch it locally before I publish it online, you'll have to install node.js, then you mush clone the repo > open a terminal in it > launch the command "npm install" > compile the project and launch the local server with "npm run dev"

ROADMAP :

- Convert SVG imported as ReactCompontents to adapt their color with the light theme (if not, duplicate icons and change their color to match the dark mode)
- Fix bug on the calculation on last XP range () , hide/show button on logs
- Connect on the official API then wrote the data on a .json filtered to have a direct access on receipe (icon and text)
- Adapt the "XP craft optimiser tool" to work on every job
- Make a english version of the tool
- Animate the transition from page to page with a slide right to left
- Add some ambiance animation (check how to make it on React/TailWind to make it efficient and not costy at all).
- List all features/tools on the main page (image with description) with a part dedicated to every tool well known by the community such as craftku, wakfu build, wakfu guide.
- Try to publish it on a VM before searching to host it online and compare the electricity cost vs an online server
