# WakfuToolsWebApp

A website app with many tools to help with the game "Wakfu" from Ankama

To launch it locally before I publish it online, you'll have to install node.js, then you mush clone the repo > open a terminal in it > launch the command "npm install" > compile the project and launch the local server with "npm run dev"
